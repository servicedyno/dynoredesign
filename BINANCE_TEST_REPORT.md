## 🔍 Issue Analysis

### Error Code: -2015

**Meaning:** "Invalid API-key, IP, or permissions for action"

**Root Causes (in order of likelihood):**

1. **IP Restriction on Binance API Key** (Most Likely)
   - Your Binance API key may have IP whitelist enabled
   - Railway's IP is not whitelisted
   - Solution: Add Railway IP or use "Unrestricted" IP setting

2. **Insufficient Permissions**
   - API key doesn't have "Enable Trading" permission
   - API key doesn't have "Enable Spot & Margin Trading"
   - Solution: Check permissions in Binance dashboard

3. **Wrong API Key Type**
   - Using Binance.US key instead of Binance.com key
   - Or vice versa
   - Solution: Verify key is from correct platform

---

## 🔧 SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: Check IP Restrictions (Recommended)

**Binance Dashboard → API Management:**

1. Go to https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management
2. Find your API key: `Ue0UNcTaS7Sydd3H4TDP...`
3. Check "IP access restrictions"

**Options:**

**A. Unrestricted (Easiest for testing):**
```
✅ Unrestricted (not recommended for production)
```

**B. Whitelist Railway IP (More Secure):**
```
Get Railway IP:
curl https://api.dynopay.com/diagnostics/binance-info

Add Railway's outbound IP to whitelist
```

---

### Solution 2: Check API Permissions

**Required permissions for auto-stablecoin conversion:**

```
✅ Enable Reading
✅ Enable Spot & Margin Trading
✅ Enable Futures (optional)
```

**NOT needed:**
```
❌ Enable Withdrawals (dangerous)
```

---

### Solution 3: Verify API Key Source

**Check that key is from:**
- ✅ https://www.binance.com (International)
- ❌ NOT https://binance.us (US version)

Binance.US uses different API keys and endpoints.

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ✅ GOOD NEWS:

1. **Railway deployment is in non-US region** ✅
   - Binance API is reachable
   - No geo-blocking
   - Public endpoints work perfectly

   - API keys are present
   - Environment variables set correctly
   - No proxy/relay needed

3. **Network connectivity works** ✅
   - Can reach Binance
   - No firewall issues
   - Low latency

### ⚠️ NEEDS FIX:

1. **API Key IP Restriction** 
   - Most likely issue
   - Easy fix in Binance dashboard

2. **API Key Permissions**
   - May need "Enable Trading" enabled
   - Quick fix in Binance dashboard

---

## 📋 Action Items

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Check Binance API Settings:**
