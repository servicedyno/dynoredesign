    content: `## Why Accept Crypto Payments?

Cryptocurrency payments are no longer niche. In 2025, over **$10 billion** in merchant transactions are processed through crypto payment gateways annually. Here's why businesses are making the switch:

- **Zero chargebacks** — Crypto transactions are final, eliminating fraud-related losses
- **Lower fees** — Typical processing fees of 0.5–1% vs 2.9% + $0.30 for credit cards
- **Global reach** — Accept payments from customers in 190+ countries without currency conversion hassles
- **Instant settlement** — No waiting 2-5 business days for funds to clear

## Getting Started with Dynopay

Dynopay makes it incredibly simple to accept crypto. You don't need any blockchain knowledge — just an API key.

### Step 1: Create Your Account

Sign up at [dynopay.com](https://dynopay.com) and complete your merchant profile. You'll need:
- Business name and email
- At least one crypto wallet address (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- Your preferred base currency (USD, EUR, GBP)

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

Navigate to the **API** section in your dashboard and create a new key. This single key is all you need to start accepting payments.

### Step 3: Create a Payment (Just One API Call!)

With Dynopay's **userless payment** feature, you can create a checkout in a single API call:

\`\`\`javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.dynopay.com/api/user/createPayment', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': 'your_api_key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 49.99,
    redirect_uri: 'https://yourstore.com/order/success',
    webhook_url: 'https://yourstore.com/webhooks/payment'
  })
});

const { data } = await response.json();
// Redirect customer to data.redirect_url
window.location.href = data.redirect_url;
\`\`\`

That's it! Your customer is redirected to a beautiful hosted checkout page where they can pay with BTC, ETH, USDT, or any supported cryptocurrency.

### Step 4: Handle Webhooks

When a payment completes, Dynopay sends a webhook to your server:

\`\`\`javascript
app.post('/webhooks/payment', (req, res) => {
  const { transaction_id, status, amount } = req.body;
  
  if (status === 'completed') {
    // Mark order as paid in your database
    // Send confirmation email to customer
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
\`\`\`

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

Dynopay supports 15+ cryptocurrencies including:
- **Bitcoin (BTC)** — The most widely accepted
- **Ethereum (ETH)** — Popular for tech-savvy customers
- **USDT (TRC-20 & ERC-20)** — Stablecoin, no volatility risk
- **USDC** — Regulated stablecoin
- **Litecoin (LTC)** — Fast confirmations
- **Solana (SOL)** — Ultra-low fees
- And more: DOGE, TRX, BCH, XRP, RLUSD, POLYGON

## Auto-Convert to Stablecoins

Worried about crypto price volatility? Dynopay can automatically convert incoming crypto payments to USDT or USDC, so you always receive a stable value.

## Conclusion

Accepting crypto payments in 2025 is easier than ever. With Dynopay's single API call integration, you can be up and running in minutes — not days. No blockchain expertise required, no complex infrastructure to manage.

    content: `## The Volatility Problem

Imagine you sell a product for $100 and accept Bitcoin. At the time of purchase, you receive 0.0015 BTC worth exactly $100. But by the time you convert to fiat three days later, Bitcoin has dropped 8% — your $100 sale is now worth $92.

This volatility risk is the #1 reason merchants hesitate to accept crypto. But it doesn't have to be this way.

## What Is Stablecoin Settlement?

Stablecoin settlement means that when a customer pays you in any cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.), the payment is **automatically converted to a stablecoin** like USDT or USDC before it reaches your wallet.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. 1 USDT = $1.00, always.

## How It Works with Dynopay

1. **Customer pays** in BTC, ETH, or any supported crypto
2. **Dynopay receives** the crypto payment and confirms it on-chain
3. **Auto-conversion** kicks in — the crypto is instantly converted to your chosen stablecoin
4. **You receive** USDT or USDC in your wallet — stable value, guaranteed

The entire process takes seconds, not days. And you never touch the volatile asset.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

| Scenario | Without Auto-Convert | With Auto-Convert |
|---|---|---|
| Customer pays $100 in BTC | You receive 0.0015 BTC | You receive 100 USDT |
| BTC drops 10% next day | Your BTC is worth $90 | Your USDT is still $100 |
| BTC rises 10% next day | Your BTC is worth $110 | Your USDT is still $100 |
| **Revenue predictability** | ❌ Unpredictable | ✅ Guaranteed |

## When to Use Auto-Convert

**Use auto-convert if you:**
- Run an e-commerce store with fixed pricing
- Need predictable revenue for accounting
- Pay suppliers or employees in fiat
- Don't want to speculate on crypto prices

**Skip auto-convert if you:**
- Want to hold crypto as an investment
- Are comfortable with price volatility
- Already have a crypto treasury strategy

## Setting Up Auto-Convert in Dynopay

Enable auto-conversion in your Dynopay dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Payment Settings**
2. Toggle **Auto-Convert** to ON
3. Choose your settlement currency (USDT or USDC)
4. Choose your settlement chain (TRC-20, ERC-20, etc.)
5. Save — all future payments will be auto-converted

## Conclusion

Stablecoin settlement is the best of both worlds: you get the benefits of accepting crypto (low fees, no chargebacks, global reach) without the volatility risk. It's like accepting USD directly, but through the crypto rails.

    content: `## The Hidden Cost of Credit Cards

Every time a customer swipes their credit card, you lose money. The standard credit card processing fee is **2.9% + $0.30 per transaction**. For a business processing $100,000/month, that's **$3,200/month** in fees alone.

But that's just the beginning. Factor in:
- **Chargeback fees**: $15–$100 per dispute
- **Monthly gateway fees**: $10–$50
- **PCI compliance fees**: $50–$200/year
- **Currency conversion fees**: 1–3% for international cards
- **Rolling reserves**: 5–10% held back for months

## Crypto Payment Fees: A Breath of Fresh Air

With Dynopay, the fee structure is dramatically simpler and cheaper:

| Fee Type | Credit Cards | Dynopay (Crypto) |
|---|---|---|
| Processing fee | 2.9% + $0.30 | 0.5% – 1% |
| Chargebacks | $15–$100 each | $0 (impossible) |
| Monthly fees | $10–$50 | $0 |
| International fees | 1–3% extra | $0 |
| Settlement time | 2–5 days | Instant |
| Rolling reserves | 5–10% held | None |

## Real-World Savings

Let's calculate the savings for different business sizes:

### Small Business ($10,000/month)
- **Credit cards**: $10,000 × 2.9% + ($0.30 × 200 transactions) = $350/month
- **Dynopay**: $10,000 × 1% = $100/month
- **Monthly savings: $250** ($3,000/year)

### Medium Business ($50,000/month)
- **Credit cards**: $50,000 × 2.9% + ($0.30 × 800 transactions) = $1,690/month
- **Dynopay**: $50,000 × 0.75% = $375/month
- **Monthly savings: $1,315** ($15,780/year)

### Large Business ($250,000/month)
- **Credit cards**: $250,000 × 2.9% + ($0.30 × 3,000 transactions) = $8,150/month
- **Dynopay**: $250,000 × 0.5% = $1,250/month
- **Monthly savings: $6,900** ($82,800/year)

## The Chargeback Advantage

Chargebacks are the silent killer of e-commerce profits. The average merchant loses **1.47% of revenue** to chargebacks and disputes. With crypto:
- Transactions are **irreversible by design**
- No chargeback fees, ever
- No dispute management overhead
- No lost merchandise from friendly fraud

## But What About Customer Adoption?

The common concern: \"Do my customers even have crypto?\" The answer in 2025 is increasingly yes:
- **420 million** people worldwide own cryptocurrency
- **40% of millennials** have purchased crypto
- Crypto payments grew **300%** year-over-year in e-commerce

And with Dynopay's hosted checkout, customers can pay with any crypto they hold — the experience is as simple as any credit card checkout.

## Getting Started

Switching to crypto payments doesn't mean abandoning credit cards. Most merchants offer both options and let customers choose. With Dynopay:

1. **Sign up** in 5 minutes
2. **Add your wallet addresses** for the cryptos you want to accept
3. **Integrate with one API call** — no complex setup
4. **Start saving** on every transaction

    content: `## The Problem with Traditional Crypto Payment APIs

Most crypto payment gateways require a multi-step integration:
1. Create a customer account
2. Store the customer token
3. Use the token to create payments
4. Handle token expiration and refresh

This means more code, more database storage, more things that can break. For many use cases (one-time purchases, donations, simple checkouts), this complexity is unnecessary.

## Introducing Userless Payment

Dynopay's **Userless Payment** feature eliminates all that complexity. You can create a payment with a single API call using just your API key:

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST https://api.dynopay.com/api/user/createPayment \\
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"amount": 50, "redirect_uri": "https://yoursite.com/thanks"}'
\`\`\`

That's it. One call. No customer creation, no token management, no complexity.

## How It Works Under the Hood

When you make an API call with only your \`x-api-key\` header (no Authorization/Bearer token), Dynopay:

1. **Validates your API key** — confirms your merchant identity
2. **Auto-creates an internal customer** — handled transparently, you never see it
3. **Processes the payment** — returns a checkout URL or QR code immediately

The internal customer is reused across calls, so there's no performance overhead.

## Two Flavors of Userless Payment

### Hosted Checkout (createPayment)
Redirect customers to Dynopay's hosted checkout page:

\`\`\`javascript
const res = await axios.post('https://api.dynopay.com/api/user/createPayment', {
  amount: 25.00,
  redirect_uri: 'https://yoursite.com/success',
  webhook_url: 'https://yoursite.com/webhooks/payment'
}, {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': API_KEY }
});

// Redirect customer
window.location.href = res.data.data.redirect_url;
\`\`\`

### Direct QR Code (cryptoPayment)
Generate a QR code and wallet address for your own UI:

\`\`\`javascript
const res = await axios.post('https://api.dynopay.com/api/user/cryptoPayment', {
  amount: 25.00,
  currency: 'BTC',
  redirect_uri: 'https://yoursite.com/success'
}, {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': API_KEY }
});

// Display in your UI
const { qr_code, address, amount, currency } = res.data.data;
\`\`\`

## When to Use Userless vs Customer-Based

| Use Case | Recommended Flow |
|---|---|
| E-commerce checkout | ✅ Userless |
| Donation page | ✅ Userless |
| Invoice payments | ✅ Userless |
| SaaS subscriptions | ✅ Customer-based |
| Marketplace (per-seller wallets) | ✅ Customer-based |
| In-app wallet balance | ✅ Customer-based |

## Backward Compatible

The best part? Userless payment is fully backward compatible. If you later decide you need per-customer tracking, just add the \`Authorization: Bearer\` header — the same endpoints work both ways.

## Try It Now

Get your API key from the [Dynopay dashboard](https://dynopay.com) and make your first userless payment in under 5 minutes.
