# DynoPay UI Automation Test Report

## Test Credentials
- **Email**: nomadly@moxx.co
- **Password**: Katiekendra123@
- **Company**: Nomadly1
- **Pod URL**: https://crypto-settlement-1.preview.emergentagent.com

## Pre-Test Fixes
1. **Deleted "Kane Dav" test company** (ID: 34) from PostgreSQL so Nomadly1 is the default company
2. **Fixed `/pay-links` routing bug** — `/pay-links` was matching `/pay` prefix in `_app.tsx`, causing it to use the Checkout theme (which lacks `palette.border`). Fixed by changing `pathname.startsWith("/pay")` → `pathname.startsWith("/pay/") || pathname === "/pay"`
3. **Added safe fallback** in `PaymentLinksTable.tsx` for `theme.palette.border.main`
