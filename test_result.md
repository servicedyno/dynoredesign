## Phase 3: Railway Log Analysis & TRON Fixes — 2026-03-23 05:30:00 UTC
- agent: main
- message: Fixed critical TRON OUT_OF_ENERGY settlement failures and related issues:
  1. TronEnergy: Token activation check now defaults to NEW recipient (130k energy) when check fails — prevents OUT_OF_ENERGY
  2. TronEnergy: calculateDynamicTRC20Fee uses NEW_RECIPIENT energy (130k) as safe default
  3. TronEnergy: feeLimit buffer increased from 20% → 50%
  4. TronEnergy: Dynamic fee buffer increased from 15% → 40%
  5. SmartGas: Safety buffer increased from 30% → 50%
  6. State machine: Allow processing → processing transition for retries
  7. WebhookQueue: Auto-cleanup of old failed jobs (>1hr) from DLQ
  8. Fee wallet alerts: Zero-balance unused wallets no longer trigger alert emails

## Phase 4: Payment Link Creation Bug Fix — 2026-03-24
- agent: main
- message: Fixed critical "Create Payment Link" button unresponsive bug for new users
- Root cause: PAYLINK_FEE_PREVIEW dispatch set `loading=true` via PAYLINK_INIT for users with 0 payment links, and never reset it. The click handler checked `paymentLinkState?.loading` which was stuck at true.
- Fixes applied:
  1. paymentLinkReducer.ts: PAYLINK_INIT now skips loading=true for FEE_PREVIEW crudType
  2. paymentLinkReducer.ts: PAYLINK_FEE_PREVIEW case now resets loading=false
  3. paymentLinkReducer.ts: PAYLINK_CREATE case now also resets loading=false
  4. CreatePaymentLink/index.tsx: handleCreatePaymentLink checks createLoading instead of generic loading
- Files changed: Redux/Reducers/paymentLinkReducer.ts, Components/Page/CreatePaymentLink/index.tsx

## Phase 5: Currency Validation Fix — Payment Link INR/PKR/AED — 2026-03-24
- agent: main
- message: Fixed "Please enter proper values!" error when creating payment links with INR (India), PKR (Pakistan), AED (UAE) currencies
- Root cause: linkMiddleware.ts allowedCurrency list was missing INR, PKR, AED, and 15+ other currencies that were already supported in paymentController.ts and currencyUtils.ts
- Fixes applied:
  1. linkMiddleware.ts: Added 20 missing currencies (INR, PKR, AED, SAR, PHP, THB, IDR, MYR, VND, KRW, TWD, SEK, NOK, DKK, PLN, CZK, HUF, RON, TRY, ILS)
  2. paymentController.ts: Added PKR to validFiatCurrencies (line 8217)

- Files changed: backend/middleware/linkMiddleware.ts, backend/controller/paymentController.ts, Components/Page/CreatePaymentLink/index.tsx

## Phase 6: TRX Gas Wallet Drain Fix — Profitability-First Sweep — 2026-03-24
- agent: main
- message: Fixed TRX fee wallet silent drain bug in scheduled sweeps
- Root cause: In sweepPoolAddress(), gas was funded from the TRX fee wallet BEFORE checking if the sweep was profitable. Unprofitable sweeps would skip the sweep but waste 15-45 TRX gas each time. Every 15 min cron tick could drain TRX without any actual sweeps happening.
- Fix: Moved profitability check BEFORE gas funding. Now the sequence is:
  1. Estimate fees (API call, no gas needed)
  2. Check profitability
  3. If NOT profitable → skip immediately, zero gas wasted
  4. If profitable → fund gas, then sweep
- Files changed: backend/services/merchantPool/merchantPoolSweep.ts
